Simon Game made with JS
The "Simon" game is a memory and sequence game in which players must repeat a sequence of colors or sounds generated by the game. Below, I provide a brief description of the JavaScript code used to create the "Simon" game:

The code for the "Simon" game uses JavaScript in conjunction with HTML and CSS to create an interactive experience. In this game, the main components include:

- Sequence Generation: The code generates random sequences of colors or sounds that the player must follow and repeat.

- User Interaction: It detects user actions, such as clicking buttons or using the keyboard to repeat the sequence.

- Answer Checking: It verifies whether the user's responses match the sequence generated by the game. If the responses are correct, the player advances to the next level; otherwise, the game may end.

- Feedback: It provides visual and auditory feedback to inform the player about their progress and mistakes.

- Levels and Difficulty: The game can have multiple levels, and the difficulty increases as the player progresses, meaning longer and more challenging sequences.

In summary, the JavaScript code for the "Simon" game is responsible for generating sequences, interacting with the user, checking responses, and controlling the dynamics of the game, creating an entertaining and challenging experience that tests the player's memory and concentration.
